# Arithmetic Generator with LCD

This project is an Arduino-based arithmetic quiz generator using an I2C LCD display and a push button. It randomly generates basic math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and displays them on the LCD. The user can reveal the answer by pressing the button.

## Features

- Randomly generates arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Displays problems and answers on a 16x2 I2C LCD
- User interaction via a single push button
- Configurable to enable/disable specific types of problems
- All code written in C++ for Arduino

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (Uno, Nano, etc.)
- I2C 16x2 LCD display (address 0x27 by default)
- Push button (connected to D2 with internal pull-up)
- Jumper wires

## Wiring

| LCD Pin | Arduino Pin |
|---------|-------------|
| VCC     | 5V          |
| GND     | GND         |
| SDA     | A4 (Uno/Nano) |
| SCL     | A5 (Uno/Nano) |

Push button:  
One side to D2, the other to GND (using `INPUT_PULLUP` in code).

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware as described above.
2. Upload the code in `LCD_MATH.ino` to your Arduino.
3. The LCD will display a random math problem.
4. Press the button to reveal the answer, then press again for the next problem.

## Configuration

You can enable or disable specific types of problems by changing these macros at the top of the code:

```cpp
#define TEST_PLUS 1
#define TEST_MINUS 1
#define TEST_MULTIPLY 1
#define TEST_DIVIDE 1
```
Set to `1` to enable, `0` to disable.

You can also adjust the number range by changing:

```cpp
#define Number_Limit 20
```
